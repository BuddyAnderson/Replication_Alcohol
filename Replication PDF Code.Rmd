## Replication Paper
The paper partially replicated in what follows is Frank Schilbach's *Alcohol and Self-Control: A Field Experiment in India*. As I am interested in experimental economics, particularly field experiements, this was an excellent learning opportunity for a multitude of reasons. For one, I learned a little about STATA. My experience with coding in general has been limited up to this point so exposure to a new language is always valuable, particularly a language that is widely used in academia. Secondly, I learned a little more about R than I previously knew. And arguably most importantly, I disected an experiment and attempted to follow the reasoning of a practiced experimental economist so as to better understand what it is I might be doing for my dissertation.

## An experience with STATA

- After finding an interesting paper I needed to make sure I could actually run their code
- I went through the process of running their code, which took a great deal longer than anticipated as I had to repeatedly alter certain aspects or install packages before the code would actually run without error
- For example:
```{r out.width='70%', out.height='70%', fig.align='center',echo=FALSE}
library(png)
library(grid)
f1 <- readPNG("Images/stata1.png")
 grid.raster(f1)
```

## Replicating STATA
- After successfully running the STATA code and generating the same figures and tables the authors used in their paper I shifted to replicating some of their results
- Of primary interest was graphical replication as those are the things that normally stick in your mind from a study
- The following few slides compare and contrast figures that I was able to reproduce with some level of success

# Now with R

## First, let's source the code from a seprate script
- The following graph was called from a script that is part of this project, but not part of the Rmarkdown document
- This is an extremely useful reference tool for future projects requiring real time updating with data!!!

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="49%", out.height="40%", fig.cap="Graph Generated in Seprate Script"}
source("Figure 3_Panel A_Replication.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
p
```

## Now compare to original
- These graphs are fairly similar, but certainly more could be done to make them closer to identical

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="49%", out.height="40%",fig.cap="Comparrison of Figure 3, Panel A",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
 knitr::include_graphics(c("Images/OriginalFig3.png","Images/RepFig3.png"))
``` 


## Let's do the same type of thing with Table 3 
Just kidding, this was advised against. We'll circle back if we have time.

\pagebreak
## Instead, lets consider an extension
- Maybe the results are being driven by heavy drinkers
- For instance, if you look at a simple histogram of the typical amount of drinks had by subjects...

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Histogram of Daily Standard Drinks", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.height="40%", out.width="49%"}
source("Figure 3_Panel A_Replication.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
hist(ndt$Std_drinks_overall_BL)
```
